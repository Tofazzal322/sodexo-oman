        "paragraph":"There are several fundamental drivers that really matter when it comes to health, nutrition and the provision of school meals. But underpinning them all is the importance of getting the basics right. So, what are those basics are and why are they so critical?A nutritious diet is essential for the health and wellbeing of children and teens. They need the right fuel for their growth and development. Consuming the right food and drink at school has a positive impact on their bodies and brains, whilst helping to establish their lifelong eating habits.To promote healthy eating in schools, it’s vital to encourage children to eat a wide-ranging, nutrient-rich diet from an early age. School meals should be at the very heart of this process. They are often the only opportunity for a child to consume a variety of fresh ingredients. And they are an important weapon in the fight against childhood obesity."
